# parse-kinogo program

Program will be crated just with aim to try parse html with python.
Kinogo.club site doesn't have ay API and doesn't provide for users the way to sort films by their rating, filter films by quality of video and audio.
I want to create parser that will filter all films by video and audio quality and will choose good films according to some patterns in comments from users.
