# parse-kinogo program

Program will be created just with aim to learn how to parse html with python.
Kinogo.club site doesn't have any API and doesn't provide for users the way to sort films by their rating, filter films by quality of video and audio.
I want to create parser that will filter all films by video and audio quality and will choose good films according to some patterns in comments from users.
